# Cartwheel Demo

- After exusted google search for how to run a websocket server with vite, I ended up using claude.ai to help me set up a vite project with websockets. It was surpisingly simple as its just normal vite & then the server as a seperate thing with its own run. I saw running plugins and proxys with vite & was expecting something more complicated. This is a good solution as I can keep the UI dev server up and running with hot reloading & I just need to restart the server when I create a change.

- To test the initial server code, I installed VSCode plugin called WebSocket Client. I wanted to make sure the server was running well & usable before trying to build a client.
